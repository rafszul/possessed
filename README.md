---

don't u just love the short description? let's have it again

possessed with fire is an impertinent and volatile synthesis of [modern web tech](http://goo.gl/5e9f0); intoxicated with primitive game mechanics and [heavy acid techno](http://goo.gl/p1Glpv); then set on a mathematically defined collision course with dynamic and razor-edged [scalable vector graphics](http://goo.gl/Zf9BBh)

for some visual feel check out http://possessed.surge.sh/ or click the graphic below.

the game is in s very early stage of development and at the moment it all seems like gathering of the assets and lots and lots of zombie coding.

some materials and graphical elements which might inspire some of the artwork that eventually will end up as part of the game can be seen here:

while other [graphics](http://padlet.com/rafszul/shadows) already went through the meat-grinder and are awaiting further work in [/img folder](img/shadows-svg) of this repo.



credits and info re origin of the assets can be found in previously mentioned [efb1d4a4428d651c4c5e](https://gist.github.com/rafszul/efb1d4a4428d651c4c5e) as well as in [credits.md](credits.md) and [canvas-exploration-credits.md](canvas-exploration-credits.md)
